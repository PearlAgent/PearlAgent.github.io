# Welcome to the official website for Pearl!

Pearl is a production-ready reinforcement learning AI agent library. Pearl enables researchers and practitioners to develop Reinforcement Learning AI agents. These AI agents prioritize cumulative long-term feedback over immediate feedback and can adapt to environments with limited observability, sparse feedback, and high stochasticity. We hope that Pearl offers the community a means to build state-of-the-art Reinforcement Learning AI agents that can adapt to a wide range of complex production environments.
